#### Problem statement
Unicorn Investors wants to make an investment in a new form of transportation - JetRail. JetRail uses Jet propulsion technology to run rails and move people at a high speed! The investment would only make sense if they can get more than 1 Million monthly users with in next 18 months. In order to help Unicorn Ventures in their decision, you need to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months. You are provided with traffic data of JetRail since inception in the test file.

#### Hypotheses
1. Traffic will increase with time
2. High traffic between the months of May and October
3. Weekday traffic will be greater than weekend traffic
